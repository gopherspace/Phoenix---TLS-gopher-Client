Phoenix TLS Gopher+ Client – User Manual (2025)


Welcome to Phoenix, your modern gateway to Gopherspace. This manual explains the core features of the client.

1. TLS/gophers Support
----------------------

Phoenix natively supports encrypted connections.

    Usage: Enter gophers:// instead of gopher:// in the address bar to establish a secure TLS connection.
    Security: By default, Phoenix accepts self-signed certificates. Click on the lock icon to view certificate status messages.

2. Bookmark Management
----------------------

Manage your favorite Gopherspace locations efficiently.

    Adding: Click the star icon or select "Add Bookmark" while browsing a page.
    Managing: Use the "Bookmarks" menu to access, edit, or delete saved entries. Bookmarks are stored locally and persist after a restart.

3. Gopher+ Metadata Support
---------------------------

Phoenix can process extended information beyond the standard Gopher protocol.

    Feature: If a server supports Gopher+, Phoenix detects author metadata or alternative file formats.
    Usage: Move your mouse over a link marked with [+]. Press and hold the Shift key while hovering over it to display the Gopher+ metadata.

4. enhanced:eXperience Support
------------------------------

This feature adds color highlights to Gopher.

    Auto-Detection: 	Phoenix detects if a Gopher server supports accents by checking for the enhanced:eXperience tag within the gophermap file.
    Presentation: 		gophermap files are displayed with enhanced formatting, providing a modern reading experience within the classic protocol.
    How it works: 		A file named enhanced.experience is placed on the Gopher server parallel (in the same directory) to the gophermap.
    Technical Details: 	The enhanced.experience file is in JSON format. It contains a line-based mapping of available colors (accents). Each line of a gophermap can be colored individually; 6 colors are available. Lines are counted starting from 0.
    Color Table: 		accent = accentblue | success = green | danger = red | warning = orange | header = blue | secondary = grey
    
	Structure of the enhanced.experience file:
	
    In this example, lines 0, 7, and 17 of a gophermap are highlighted with accentblue and orange:
	
    json

    {
      "rules": {
        "0": "accent",
        "7": "accent",
        "17": "warning"
      }
    }


5. Dynamic Theme Engine (12 Designs)
------------------------------------

The appearance of Phoenix can be customized to your preference.

    Changing Themes: Go to "Settings" -> "Themes".
    Selection: Choose from 12 designs. The change is applied immediately to all windows.

6. Internationalization Support (8 Languages)
---------------------------------------------

Phoenix supports multiple languages.

    Languages: The client supports 8 languages, including German, English, French, Spanish, and Italian.
    Settings: The language is automatically detected on first launch but can be changed manually in the settings at any time.
